Wordle-Like Game

The Wordle-Like Game is a Java-based implementation of a word guessing game inspired by the popular Wordle format. 
Key features include:

Game Mechanics: Read puzzle words from a file, validate user guesses against a predefined dictionary, and provide feedback on letter correctness using color codes (green for correct letters in the correct position, yellow for correct letters in the wrong position, and red for incorrect letters).

Gameplay Logic: Manage win/loss conditions and implement pixel manipulation for graphical feedback on user guesses.

This project demonstrates my ability to implement game logic, manage user interactions, and utilize file handling in Java.
